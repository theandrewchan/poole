                    I'm Andrew, a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Physics.
                    I work across the stack and you'll see projects involving everything from frontend web development
                    to data science to regular ole interesting problems I've encountered.

                    Also my roommate and I are novice freestyle rappers. You'll be glad you knew me when I drop a million dollar mixtape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last summer I wrote software for my <a href="https://here.com/en">self-driving research team at HERE</a>.
                    Right now I'm a project developer in <a href="http://codebase.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley CodeBase</a>;
                    we're developing the consumer mobile app for <a href="https://mysutro.com/">Sutro</a>, a smart water-monitoring device manufacturer.

                    I <3 React! I'm a contributor to <a href="https://github.com/gor181/react-chartjs-2">react-chartjs-2</a> and recently made a (almost full) copy of the SoundCloud client for educational purposes. Check out a live statically hosted version <a href="https://beautician-edward-85868.netlify.com/">here</a>. There's a tonnn of other projects on my github as well - see <a href="https://github.com/theandrewchan/farmr">farmr</a>, a React Native app for farmers I made at HackDavis 2016, or <a href="https://github.com/theandrewchan/tweet-runner">tweetrunner</a>, a little game made in 18 hours with vanilla JavaScript that responds to the live twitter stream.
