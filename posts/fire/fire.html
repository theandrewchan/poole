  <h1>Simulating Fluids, Fire, and Smoke in Real-Time</h1>
  <h2>My notes on the math, algorithms, and methods involved in simulating fluids like fire and smoke in real-time.</h2>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>
  <p>
    Fire is hard to simulate.
    As a fluid, it shares the challenging dynamics of oil, water, and smoke, but with the added
    complexity of much higher turbulence, detail, and speeds. In particular, the
    rapid thermal expansion of hot gases that characterize flames need to be simulated at high
    resolutions to be accurate, so real-time simulation of fire was considered computationally infeasible for a long time.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result, past approaches to animating believable, realistic fire often used various shortcuts to
    approximate or bypass modeling its dynamics. Even in movies - where visual effects can be pre-rendered
    and simulation speed is not as much of an issue - physically-based fire simulation only recently
    became common. For instance, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy <dt-cite key="Aitken:2004:LRV:1103900.1103911"></dt-cite> used sprite-based techniques as an
    "intelligent hack" to render the Balrog's fire because the full fluid-dynamics based simulation was too computationally
    expensive; turnaround time on rendering shots was too slow and thus not directable.
    In real-time applications like video games, fire, smoke, and explosion effects have pretty much exclusively
    used sprite-based or (non-physical) procedural approaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the explosion in GPU computing power in the last decade has made fast fluid simulation viable and even easy.
    As it turns out, modeling fluid dynamics is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallelizable</a> for most practical purposes, and the basic
    algorithms are straightforward to implement on the GPU, with Harris's 2005 chapter in <i>GPU Gems</i> offering a great
    basic tutorial <dt-cite key="harris2005fast"></dt-cite>. In 2009, Industrial Light and Magic's awesome fire in
    <i>Harry Potter</i> used the GPU for modeling and rendering, and was both fast and directable for the first time <dt-cite key="horvath2009directable"></dt-cite>.
    Real-time fire is a thing now; in 2014, NVIDIA released FlameWorks, a system for generating fire, smoke, and explosion effects for games.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how do we simulate fire on the GPU? To do so, we'll need to understand some basic fluid dynamics,
    parallel algorithms for modeling fluids, and the combustion models that define fire and smoke. We'll assume a reasonable
    background in vector calculus and differential equations (know how to take the gradient of a vector). Numerical methods
    (know what a finite difference is) will be helpful as well. Finally, we'll be implementing algorithms throughout
    using the awesome power of WebGL in the browser.
  </p>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>
  <h2>1. Fluid Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    Before we simulate fire, we'll first tackle the more general problem of simulating a fluid. We'll also make the assumptions
    that our fluid is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_flow">incompressible</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inviscid_flow">inviscid</a>, which are fairly reasonable assumptions that will vastly simplify our problem.
  </p>
  <h3>1.1 Basic Fluid Dynamics</h3>
  <p>
    Suppose \(D\) is a region in space filled with a fluid. At any point \( \mathbf{x} \in D \) and time \(t\), the fluid has velocity \(\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, t)\).
    Computationally, we can represent the 2D velocity field \( \mathbf{u} \) with an \( N \times N \) grid, where the equally spaced grid points give the value of
    the velocity field at that point in space.
    $$
    \text{Grid diagram here}
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    What will happen if we put a drop of dye in the fluid?
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's define a scalar field \( \psi (\mathbf{x}, t) \) as the density of the dye at any point in space and time.
    The transport of quantities like \( \psi \) within a fluid by the fluid's velocity is called <b>advection</b>.
    Given some fluid's velocity field and an initial density field of our dye, we'd like to see how the dye's density everywhere
    evolves over time by simulating its advection through the fluid.
  </p>
  <p><b>A Naive Method for Advection</b></p>
  <p>
    One idea to compute the advection is to take each grid point, move forward the direction and distance that would be traveled
    by a particle at the grid point's velocity and the simulation timestep \( \Delta t \), and update the grid point nearest to where the particle lands:

    $$
    \psi (\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{x}, t), t + \Delta t) = \psi (\mathbf{x}, t)
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    This is in fact Euler's method, a simple method for forward integration of ODEs. Unfortunately, this approach has 2 issues:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It can't be implemented in a parallel way, since 2 grid points can end up in the same target point after forward evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
      More importantly, for many problems it's unstable for time steps above some number, causing \( \psi \) to blow up.
      This is an issue for Euler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method#Numerical_stability">in general</a>, making it unsuitable for most situations.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>The Advection Partial Differential Equations</b></p>
  <p>
    This whole time we've been implicitly solving a PDE! If we're going to derive a stable method for advection, we'll need to
    first derive an explicit expression for our PDE. Let's start from first principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider a fixed region of space \(W\) (that is, \(W\) does <i>not</i> vary with time). The total mass of dye within \(W\)
    is \( \int_{W} \psi dV\). Over time, the change in mass is:

    $$
    \frac{d}{dt} \int_{W} \psi (\mathbf{x}, t) dV = \int_{W} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi (\mathbf{x}, t) dV \\
    $$

    Now, letting \(S\) denote the surface of \(W\) and \( \mathbf{n} \) the outward normal vector defined along the surface, we can examine
    the mass flow rate through the surface of \(W\). In particular, observe that the volume flow rate - the <i>volume</i> of fluid that
    flows through per second </i> - across \(S\) per unit area is \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n} \) and the mass flow rate per unit area
    is \( \psi \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n} \).

    $$
    \text{surface flow diagram here}
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    This gives us the <b>law of conservation of mass</b> in integral form:

    $$
    \frac{d}{dt} \int_{W} \psi dV = - \int_{S} \psi \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n} dA \tag{1}
    $$

    Can we get rid of the integrals and say something similar for points? By divergence theorem, the above is equivalent to

    $$
    \int_{W} [\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\psi \mathbf{u})] dV = 0
    $$

    Then for a unit subregion \( W = dV \), we can say that

    $$
    \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\psi \mathbf{u}) = 0 \tag{2}
    $$

    Take a moment to note that the above equation isn't really saying anything new and is essentially a differential form
    of the law of conservation of mass. But importantly, we have an explicit PDE that we need to solve for \( \psi \)!
  </p>
  <p>
    Hmm... we could stop here, but we might be able to simplify this more. Specifically, it looks like we could isolate out
    a term \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \) that goes to zero because of incompressibility.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\psi \mathbf{u}) \\
    &= - (\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \psi u + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \psi v) \\
    &= - (\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \psi +  \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} v + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \psi) \\
    &= - (\psi \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \psi) \\
    &= - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \psi \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Applying our incompressibility constraint \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0 \) at the end yields a scalar PDE, the first of our <b>incompressible flow advection equations</b>:

    $$
    \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \text{advection} (\mathbf{u}, \psi) = - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \psi \tag{3a}
    $$
    $$
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} = \text{advection} (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \tag{3b}
    $$

    Eq. 3b for advecting a vector field \( \mathbf{v} \) through our velocity field can be derived similarly to the scalar advection equation.
  </p>
  <p><b>A Stable Method for Advection</b></p>
  <p>
    Let's look closely at eqn. (3a):
    $$
    \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \psi
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that the right-hand term is a directional derivative in the \( -\mathbf{u} \) direction. This gives us a wonderful new method for
    advecting \( \psi \) by an incompressible fluid - starting at a grid point \( \mathbf{x} \), trace the fluid velocity <i>backwards</i>,
    replacing the value at our original point by the value that we land on (if we land between points, we can interpolate):

    $$
    \psi (\mathbf{x}, t + \Delta t) = \psi (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{x}, t), t)
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    This method is called
    <b>Semi-Lagrangian advection</b> and made waves (hah) when it was invented in 1999 by Jos Stam <dt-cite key="stam1999stable"></dt-cite>.
    Like Euler, it's first-order accurate, but has exactly the additional properties we need:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It's extremely easy to parallelize because each grid point only gets updated once per iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
      It's <i>unconditionally stable</i>. Why? Observe that for any grid point, the maximum value it can get updated to is the maximum value
      of all the grid points.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For a fixed velocity field, it works great. Click anywhere below to drop some dye in the flow:

  <h3>1.2 The Navier-Stokes Equations</h3>
  <p>
    So far we've found a model that describes how scalar properties of a fluid evolve over time, assuming the flow is fixed. What about the fluid flow itself -
    how does the velocity field \( \mathbf{u} \) affect itself over time?
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>Navier-Stokes equations</b>
    <dt-fn>For a detailed derivation, see Chapter 1.3 of Chorin and Marsden (1993).</dt-fn>
    <dt-fn>
      I would be remiss if I didn't mention the remarkable outstanding math problem associated with Navier-Stokes.
      These equations, despite having a fairly easy derivation, strong empirical support, and widespread practical usage,
      are not completely understood theoretically. In fact, basic properties of the solutions to Navier-Stokes have never been
      proven. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness">Navier-Stokes existence
      and smoothness</a> problem asks for a proof that smooth solutions to the equations in 3 dimensions always exist
      with bounded energy; it is one of the Clay Institute's seven Millenium Prize problems in math - along with P=NP and the Riemann Hypothesis -
      and there is a $1,000,000 prize for its solution.
    </dt-fn>
    for incompressible flow define how the velocity at any point in a fluid evolves over time:

    $$
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} =
    {\underbrace{ - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} }_\text{self-advection}} +
    {\underbrace{ \mu^2 \nabla \mathbf{u} }_\text{diffusion}} -
    {\underbrace{ \nabla p }_\text{pressure}} +
    {\underbrace{ \textbf{F} }_\text{ext. forces}}
    \tag{4}
    $$
    $$
    \text{where~}\forall t{~,~} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
    $$

    Here, the constant \( \mu \) is the fluid's viscosity and \( \mathbf{F} \) are
    external forces. But we assumed earlier that our fluid was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inviscid_flow">inviscid</a>,
    so \( \mu = 0 \), and we can just ignore external forces for now. So we're left with two terms - (self) advection and pressure.
    If at every timestep we numerically compute these terms and add them, we can numerically simulate all the dynamics of our fluid!
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's take a closer look at each of these.
  </p>
  <p><b>Self-Advection</b></p>
  <p>
    From our incompressible advection equations, we can see that the self-advection term is the advection of the fluid's velocity
    field \( \mathbf{u} \) through itself:

    $$
    \text{advection} (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u}) = - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \tag{5}
    $$

    Technically, this is called <i>convection</i>, and we can compute it using our Semi-Lagrangian method from earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    So where do the other terms come from? Well, advecting \( \mathbf{u} \) through itself yields a new velocity field
    \( \mathbf{u}^\prime \) that doesn't necessarily still follow the incompressibility constraint:

    $$
    \mathbf{u}^\prime = \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}
    $$

    But this doesn't make any sense, because physically, an incompressible fluid should remain incompressible.
    So the other term in Navier-Stokes needs to correct this somehow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mathematically, we might say that \( \mathbf{u}^\prime \) is outside of the space of zero-divergence vector fields,
    and we need to project it back into that space to get the correct velocity field \( \mathbf{u}^* \) where
    \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^* = 0 \).
    <dt-fn>
      The linear algebraic terminology isn't an accident. The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition">Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition</a> tells us that
      any vector field \( \mathbf{u}^\prime \) can be <i>uniquely</i> decomposed into the sum of two orthogonal components:

      $$
      \mathbf{u}^\prime = \mathbf{u}^* + \nabla p
      $$

      where \( \mathbf{u}^* \) is divergence-free.
    </dt-fn>
    That's where the pressure term comes in.
  </p>
  <p><b>Pressure</b></p>
  <p>
    After advecting our fluid's velocity field through itself, we get a candidate velocity field \( \mathbf{u}^\prime \) that
    isn't necessarily divergence-free. But we know that the end result of Navier-Stokes will give us a divergence-free field,
    so we can assume that there exists a pressure field \( p \) that will counteract the nonzero divergence:
    <dt-fn>
      The uniqueness of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition means that the pressure field will also be unique.
    </dt-fn>

    $$
    \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u}^\prime - \nabla p) = 0
    $$

    We rearrange this to get

    $$
    \nabla^2 p = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^\prime \tag{5}
    $$

    which is a type of equation known as a <i>Poisson equation</i>, where the left-hand side is
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator">Laplacian</a> of an unknown scalar field and the
    right-hand side is a known scalar. Solving this Poisson equation is really the slowest computational step
    in fluid simulation, for reasons we will see shortly.
  </p>
  <p><b>Solving for Pressure</b></p>
  <p>
    So how do we solve this particular PDE for \( p \)? Well, we know the value of our candidate velocity field \( \mathbf{u}^\prime \)
    at all of our grid points, so we can approximately compute the right-hand side of the Poisson equation by applying a discrete
    version of the divergence everywhere:

    $$
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^\prime =
    \frac{ u_{i+1, j} - u_{i-1, j} }{ 2 \Delta x } +
    \frac{ v_{i, j+1} - v_{i, j-1} }{ 2 \Delta y }
    $$

    where \( \Delta x = \Delta y \) is the grid square length and \( \mathbf{u}^\prime = (u, v) \) in 2 dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we can use a discrete version of the Laplacian

    $$
    \nabla^2 p =
    \frac{ p_{i+1, j} + p_{i-1, j} + p_{i, j+1} + p_{i, j-1} - 4p_{i, j} }{ (\Delta x)^2 }
    $$

    to transform the whole equation into a linear equation with five unknowns.
  </p>
  <p>
    But really, we are solving the Poisson equation (5) over all of space at once, so for an \( N \times N \) grid,
    we end up with a system of \( N^2 \) linear equations with exactly \( N^2 \) unknowns! So we end up with
    the familiar old equation

    $$
    \mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}
    $$

    where \( \mathbf{A} \) is a matrix applying the Laplacian operator to the whole grid and \( \mathbf{b} \) is a vector containing
    the velocity field's divergence at all grid points.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many off-the-shelf algorithms for solving linear systems exactly. Unfortunately for us, even the fastest algorithms
    would take around \( O(N^{4.74}) \) time, which for realistic grid sizes is a really dreadful time that nobody should ever have
    to wait for.
  </p>
  <p><b>Solving for Pressure... Efficiently</b></p>
  <p>
    If we're going to make a fast simulation, no step should take any more than \( O(N^2) \) time. In fact,
    for real-time simulation, we shouldn't even have to wait linear time. We have the power of the GPU in our hands. Can we do better?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, it's not really possible to achieve an exact solution to the linear system efficiently, but we should
    note that the linear system is already an approximation to the Poisson equation. And it is possible to achieve
    arbitrarily accurate approximations with iterative methods - which begin with an estimate and improve solution
    accuracy every iteration - so we can just pick an iterative algorithm and run it
    until we have something that's "good enough". One particularly simple and easy-to-implement iterative algorithm for solving
    linear equations is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method">Jacobi method</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As littleO on mathexchange put it<dt-cite key="1465170"></dt-cite>, the Jacobi method is probably the first thing
    you would try if you were to invent your own iterative method for solving \( \mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b} \). The very first
    equation in the system is
    $$
    A_{11}x_1 + A_{12}x_2 + ... + A_{1n}x_n = b_1
    $$
    At the \(k\)th iteration, given some guess \( \mathbf{x}^k \) for the solution \( \mathbf{x} \), we have some error.
    We can use this error to update our guess for \( x_1 \) as follows:
    $$
    x_1^{k+1} = \frac{ b_1 - A_{12}x_2^k - ... - A_{1n}x_n^k }{ A_{11} }
    $$
    In Jacobi, our guesses for all elements of \( \mathbf{x} \) are executed in parallel, giving a perfect
    match for implementation on the GPU.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a remark on the accuracy and convergence of Jacobi, it's worth noting that other, faster-converging solvers can also be
    implemented on the GPU, including the Conjugate Gradient method and the Multigrid method. On the other hand, depending on
    the fluid and application context, pressure accuracy may not be as important as advection accuracy or ease of implementation.
    For fast-moving fluids like smoke and fire, changes in fluid volume aren't as visually apparent as they are for fluids like water
    <dt-cite key="Crane07"></dt-cite>, and high-quality advection tends to matter more<dt-cite key="Green2014"></dt-cite>.
  </p>
  <p><b>Summary: Simulating Navier Stokes</b></p>
  <p>
    The math behind Navier-Stokes can be a little bit dense, but at a high-level, simulating a fluid by solving the equations
    comes down to a few key update procedures on a grid per timestep. For our dye problem, here's our simulation
    might look:
    <dt-code block language="javascript">
      let u = createVelocityGrid();
      let density = createScalarGrid();
      let div = createScalarGrid();
      let p = createScalarGrid();

      while (true) {
        // Solve for the next velocity field.
        u = advect(u, u);
        div = divergence(u);

        for (let i = 0; i < JACOBI_ITERATIONS; i++) {
          p = updatePressure(p, div);
        }
        u = u - gradient(p);

        // Advect dye through the new velocity field.
        density = advect(u, density);
      }
    </dt-code>
  </p>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>
  <h3>1.3 Vorticity Confinement</h3>
  <p>
    Using a grid to store our velocity field is extremely convenient, but it results in unwanted
    numerical smoothing whenever we have to interpolate values between grid points.
    This combined with the relatively coarse approximation of a first-order Semi-Lagrangian advection
    scheme has the effect of dissipating out turbulent vortices in our flow. Physically, the velocity field
    loses energy, and the end result is generally overly smooth, "boring" fluid flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    One way to combat lost vorticity is to increase the resolution of our grid, but this isn't really feasible
    for real-time simulations that have limited computational resources. What we would ideally
    like to do is find all the small details that get smoothed over each step of the simulation, and <i>amplify</i>
    them. This process is called vorticity confinement - admittedly, it's not totally realistic, but succeeds in
    preserving small scale details in more or less physically correct locations <dt-cite key="fedkiw2001visual"></dt-cite>.
    Indeed, it was originally invented to resolve very complex flow fields in engineering simulations of helicopter blades,
    where it just wasn't possible to add the number of necessary grid points <dt-cite key="steinhoff1994modification"></dt-cite>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The smallest turbulent features we can find are the vortices centered at each grid point in our simulation.
    We can measure the intensity of these vortices (the <i>vorticity</i> of them) by taking the curl of \( \mathbf{u} \)
    at each point, and amplify them by essentially adding a circular flow scaled by vorticity about each point.
    Mathematically, the vorticity is defined by

    $$
    \bm{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{u}
    $$

    For each grid point, we compute a normalized location vector that points to the highest nearby vorticity concentration:

    $$
    \mathbf{N} = \frac{ \nabla | \bm{\omega} | }{ | \nabla | \bm{\omega} | | }
    $$

    And finally, we compute the confined vorticity vector field and add it to our flow:

    $$
    \mathbf{f_{conf}} = \epsilon (\mathbf{N} \times \bm{\omega})
    $$
    $$
    \mathbf{u_{conf}} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f_{conf}}
    $$

    Here, the confinement constant \( \epsilon > 0 \) is a parameter controlling the amount of small scale detail added
    back to the flow. Even low confinement levels (around 0-15) can make a huge difference, especially for simulations
    using Semi-Lagrangian advection schemes, and higher confinement levels can create highly stylized, billowing flows.

    $$

  </p>
  <p><b>Curl-Noise Turbulence</b></p>
  <p>
    Curl noise is a method that essentially does the same thing as vorticity confinement, but instead of measuring
    and amplifying the vorticity of the velocity field, a scalar vorticity field is made from scratch using noise functions.
    Mathematically, we can combine vorticity confinement and curl-noise turbulence by  synthesizing a random
    vorticity field

    $$
    \bm{\phi} = \text{rand} * \mathbf{z}
    $$

    Then computing our final vorticity field by

    $$
    \bm{\omega}^* = \bm{\omega} + \bm{\phi}
    $$

    Fast-moving, highly-turbulent fluids like smoke and fire benefit the most from vorticity confinement and curl noise,
    and in practice the curl noise field \( \bm{\phi} \) both evolves with time and is also advected by the fluid flow.

  <h2>2. Fire Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    If you've gotten this far, pat yourself on the back! The methods in the previous section let us efficiently
    and accurately simulate a very broad array of fluids with varying physical parameters (oil, water, honey), and degrees of accuracy,
    assuming the fluid domain takes up a fixed space. Those interested in handling varying domains (that is, fluids that occupy different regions
    within the grid, like a half-full cup of water that sloshes around) will want to explore accounting for different boundary conditions
    within the grid simulation <dt-fn>I suggest <b>Dynamic Obstacles</b> in
    <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch30.html">GPU Gems 3 Chapter 30.2</a>
    <dt-cite key="Crane07"></dt-cite> for details on adding this to our grid simulation.
    There are also non grid-based methods, but those are outside scope here. </dt-fn>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simulating fire and smoke requires a couple additional elements. First, we'll need to add channels representing
    fuel and temperature to our simulation, and model the combustion of fuel to create heat. Next we'll address how hot pockets
    of our fluid rise with a thermal buoyancy model, and finally, we'll need to render our flames correctly, taking into account
    blackbody radiation of the flames, human perception of light, and fire movement.
  </p>
  <h3>2.1 A Basic Combustion Model</h3>
  <p>
    Chemically, fire is caused by the oxidation of a fuel material in a reaction that releases both heat and light.
    In our case, we can assume that any fuel in our system has already ignited and is actively adding heat; we won't worry
    about the problem of unignited fuel.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be more specific, let's define a scalar field \( \rho \) where \( 0 \leq \rho \leq 1 \) represents the density of fuel and
    another scalar field \( T > 0 \) representing the temperature of the fluid everywhere. At every timestep, temperature is
    added to the system by the fuel, which burns at a given burn temperature:

    $$
    T^\prime = \text{max} ( T, \rho * T_{\text{burn}} )
    $$

    Of course, temperature isn't static - heat diffuses from hot to cold areas, and with fluids in particular, large-scale movements
    of molecules transport heat. The combination of these 2 processes defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection">heat convection</a>,
    and conveniently, we already have a mathematical model for how it works - advection! Simulation-wise, we advect our temperature
    field along our velocity field. Since any reacting molecules are also moved by the fluid, we should advect fuel as well.
    The heat itself also affects the movement of the fluid - we'll see how to handle this shortly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, hot molecules radiate off temperature as light<dt-fn>This is called blackbody radiation, and we'll return
    to it when rendering the fire color. The soot particles present in most fire radiate like ideal blackbodies.</dt-fn> according to the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law">Stefan-Boltzmann Law</a>,
    in a quintic equation <dt-cite key="nguyen2002physically"></dt-cite>:

    $$
    T^\prime = T - \sigma_{\text{cool}} ( \frac{T}{T_{\text{max}}} )^4 * \Delta t
    $$

    Here, \( \sigma_{\text{cool}} \) is the cooling rate parameter. For a physically correct simulation, we would set it to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
    but for a graphical simulation, it's nice for the artist to be able to control the rate of cooling.
  </p>
  <p>
    To complete our combustion model, note that our fuel is always burning (we can imagine it as the density of ionized gas particles
    that give off thermal energy and return to a lower energy state), so every timestep we dissipate it by some given burn
    rate \( \gamma_{fuel} \):
    $$
    \rho^\prime = \rho (1 - \gamma_{fuel})^{\Delta t}
    $$
  </p>
  <h3>2.2 Thermal Buoyancy</h3>
  <p>
    So far, our temperature field doesn't do anything to our fluid flow. But it should - hot pockets of air should expand and rise, and cooler pockets should fall.
    We can model this with a thermal buoyancy force. Since we're assuming incompressibility, we won't actually handle air expansion, but the fluid flow
    should experience an upward force depending on temperature:

    $$
    \mathbf{u}^\prime = \mathbf{u} + (\beta T \Delta t) \mathbf{j}
    $$

    Here, \( \beta \) is a given positive buoyancy constant, and \( \mathbf{j} \) is the upward unit vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding a combustion model and thermal buoyancy force gives us a fantastic simulator for a decidedly "fire-like" fluid -
    with the right values of buoyancy and cooling, we can get bulky, billowing plumes of material.
    Not exactly flames, but very similar to smoke. Tap and drag in the simulation below to inject some combusting fuel:

    $$
    \text{smoke simulation here}
    $$
  </p>
  <h3>2.3 Fire Rendering</h3>
  <p>
    Fire is a <a href="http://old.cescg.org/CESCG-2000/SMaierhofer/node6.html">participating medium</a>.
    What this means is that it can absorb, emit, and scatter light. Fire in particular emits light through blackbody radiation, making it
    more complex than other scattering media like fog or smoke.
  </p>
  <p>
    We won't cover light scattering in these notes, but interested readers should refer
    to 5.1 in <a href="http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2002-02.pdf">Nguyen et al. 2002</a> <dt-cite key="nguyen2002physically"></dt-cite>. We will cover realistic rendering of
    the light emitted by our flames and the use of various postprocessing techniques to achieve photorealistic fire.
  </p>
  <p><b>Blackbody Radiation</b></p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck's Law</a> describes the spectral density of light radiated by
    a black body at a given temperature \( T \):

    $$
    M(\lambda, T) = \frac{ c_1 }{ \lambda^5 } \frac{ 1 }{ \exp{ \frac{c_2}{\lambda T} } - 1 }
    $$

    where
    $$
    c_1 = 2 \pi h c^2 \\
    c_2 = \frac{hc}{k}
    $$

    and \(h\), \(c\), and \(k\) are Planck's constant, the speed of light, and Boltzmann's constant, respectively.
