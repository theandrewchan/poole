                        Programming is science dressed up as art because most of us don't understand the physics of software and it's rarely, if ever, taught.

                    <blockquote>
                        Cooking is not for the faint of heart. You must be imaginative. Strong hearted. You must try things that may not work; and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from! Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true - anyone can cook... but only the fearless can be great.

                    <blockquote>
                        Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion- not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don't understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful beauty; to be alive, damn it.

                        Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

                        With her terrible practical sense she could not understand the colonel's business as he exchanged little fishes for gold coins and then converted the coins into little fishes, and so on, with the result that he had to work all the harder with the more he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle.
                        Actually, what interested him was not the business but the work. He needed so much concentration to link scales, fit minute rubies into the eyes, laminate gills, and put on fins that there was not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill with his disillusionment of the war. So absorbing was the attention
                        required by the delicacy of his artistry that in a short time he had aged more than during all the years of the war, and his position had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight, but the implacable concentration awarded him with a peace of the spirit.
