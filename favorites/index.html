                <h2>Favorite Classes I've Taken</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>CS70 - Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just an awesome class all around. Probably the most difficult but rewarding classes I've ever taken at Cal,
                        and for a first exposure to "real" mathematics, it dives into some of the most incredible theorems ever in
                        surprising detail. The curriculum is also super well designed - the progression from sets to countability to
                        counting to probability makes you feel like you're building up the foundations of elementary math all by yourself.
                    </p>
                    <h3>EECS 126 - Probability and Random Processes</h3>
                    <p>
                        This class has a reputation for being one of the hardest courses in the undergraduate EECS curriculum.
                        Content-wise, it covers all of STAT 134 in about a month and a half and then moves on to random processes (the first half of STAT 150)
                        for the remainder of the course. Be careful not to get left behind! I was lucky enough to have Sinho as my GSI and Bertzekas and Tsiklis as my textbook.
                        The material is truly awesome - some of the most useful and cool math in EECS.

                        Programming is science dressed up as art because most of us don't understand the physics of software and it's rarely, if ever, taught.

                        Cooking is not for the faint of heart. You must be imaginative. Strong hearted. You must try things that may not work; and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from! Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true - anyone can cook... but only the fearless can be great.

                      Last time I asked: 'What does mathematics mean to you?', and some people answered: "The manipulation of numbers, the manipulation of structures.' And if I had asked what music means to you, would you have answered: 'The manipulation of notes?'

                        With her terrible practical sense she could not understand the colonel's business as he exchanged little fishes for gold coins and then converted the coins into little fishes, and so on, with the result that he had to work all the harder with the more he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle.
                        Actually, what interested him was not the business but the work. He needed so much concentration to link scales, fit minute rubies into the eyes, laminate gills, and put on fins that there was not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill with his disillusionment of the war. So absorbing was the attention
                        required by the delicacy of his artistry that in a short time he had aged more than during all the years of the war, and his position had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight, but the implacable concentration awarded him with a peace of the spirit.

                        I have to think that I have some kind of inside track on this problem.
                        That is, I have some sort of talent that the other guys aren’t using, or some way of looking,
                        and they are being foolish not to notice this wonderful way to look at it.
                        I have to think I have a little better chance than the other guys, for some reason.
                        I know in my heart that it is likely that the reason is false, and likely the particular attitude
                        I’m taking with it was thought of by others. I don’t care; I fool myself into thinking I have an extra chance.
