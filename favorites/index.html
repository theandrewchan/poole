                <div>
                    <h3>CS70 - Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just an awesome class all around. Probably the most difficult but rewarding classes I've ever taken at Cal,
                        and for a first exposure to "real" mathematics, it dives into some of the most incredible theorems ever in
                        surprising detail. The curriculum is also super well designed - the progression from sets to countability to
                        counting to probability makes you feel like you're building up the foundations of elementary math all by yourself.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Math 54 - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</h3>
                    <p>
                        I love linear algebra! Well, anyone would after taking 4 linear algebra courses. This is the third computation-style
                        (matrix theory, not proper linalg) linear algebra course I've taken so far, after Physics 89 and Electrical Engineering 16A,
                        and Math 54 beats the hell out of the first 2 with its proper mathematical treatment of the topics. To be fair,
                        Physics 89 was horribly organized (we did matrix multiplication one day and then Legendre polynomials the day after) and
                        16A sucks the joy out of the math by squeezing it into circuit and signal processing problems (what's a vector space again?).
                        Taking Math 110 now (the proper theoretical linear algebra course).

                        Programming is science dressed up as art because most of us don't understand the physics of software and it's rarely, if ever, taught.

                        Cooking is not for the faint of heart. You must be imaginative. Strong hearted. You must try things that may not work; and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from! Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true - anyone can cook... but only the fearless can be great.

                        With her terrible practical sense she could not understand the colonel's business as he exchanged little fishes for gold coins and then converted the coins into little fishes, and so on, with the result that he had to work all the harder with the more he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle.
                        Actually, what interested him was not the business but the work. He needed so much concentration to link scales, fit minute rubies into the eyes, laminate gills, and put on fins that there was not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill with his disillusionment of the war. So absorbing was the attention
                        required by the delicacy of his artistry that in a short time he had aged more than during all the years of the war, and his position had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight, but the implacable concentration awarded him with a peace of the spirit.
