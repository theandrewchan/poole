## Bio

I'm Andrew, a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Physics. I work across the stack and you'll see me making posts about everything from frontend web development to data science to regular ole interesting problems I've encountered.

Also my roommate and I are novice freestyle rappers. You'll be glad you knew me when I drop a million dollar mixtape.

## Things I've Done

Last summer I wrote software for my [self-driving research team at HERE](https://here.com/en). Right now I'm a project developer in [Berkeley CodeBase](http://codebase.club/); we're developing the consumer mobile app for [Sutro](https://mysutro.com/), a smart water-monitoring device manufacturer.

I \<3 React! I have pending contributions to [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/gor181/react-chartjs-2) and recently made a (almost full) copy of the SoundCloud client for educational purposes. Check out a live statically hosted version [here](https://theandrewchan.github.io/public/soundfoundry.html). There's a tonnn of other projects on my github as well - see [farmr](https://github.com/theandrewchan/farmr), a React Native app for farmers I made at HackDavis 2016, or [tweetrunner](https://github.com/theandrewchan/tweet-runner), a little game made in 18 hours with vanilla JavaScript that responds to the live twitter stream.
